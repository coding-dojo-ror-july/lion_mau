# Assignment: Lion
# Now, create another class called Lion that inherits from Mammal.
# Hint: super
# (Yes, this is a flying lion)
# Have the default health be 170
# Add a new method called fly, which when invoked, decreases the health by 10.
# Add a new method called attack_town, which when invoked, decreases the health by 50.
# Add a new method called eat_humans, which when invoked, increases the health by 20.
# Have the Lion attack_town three times, eat_humans twice, fly twice, and have it display its health.
# When the Lion's display_health method is called have it say 'This is a lion` 
# before it displays the default information (make sure you still call the parent's display_health function).
